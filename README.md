Bing SERP Scraper for SEO Keyword Generation

Overview:
This Python project scrapes Search Engine Results Page (SERP) results from Bing using Selenium for SEO keyword generation. It utilizes Pandas to count the occurrence of words and orders them in descending order. The project then visualizes the word frequencies using Bokeh to create a horizontal bar graph. Finally, it leverages the OpenAI API to generate content based on the extracted keywords and employs Tkinter to provide a GUI for selecting the save location.
